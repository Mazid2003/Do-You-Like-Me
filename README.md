# 💖 Do You Like Me?  

An interactive and fun little web app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The app asks the classic question: *"Do you like me?"* with a playful twist —  
- The **"No" button** tries to escape your cursor 🏃  
- The **"Maybe" button** wiggles and runs away 🤔  
- The **"Yes" button** triggers hearts 💖 and confetti 🎉  

Perfect for experimenting with UI/UX creativity, animations, and DOM manipulation.
